- [ ] [AI PROMPT - pyproject.toml:120]
In pyproject.toml around lines 117 to 120, the mypy overrides currently ignore
missing imports for both "regex" and "aiohttp"; remove "regex" from the list so
mypy will use the newly added types-regex stubs and only keep
ignore_missing_imports = true for "aiohttp" (or remove aiohttp as well if you
add its stubs). Update the module array to only include "aiohttp" and leave
ignore_missing_imports unchanged for that entry.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - pyproject.toml:128]
In pyproject.toml around lines 125-128: remove the duplicated
[dependency-groups] dev = [...] block entirely, and instead add
"types-regex>=2025.7.34.20250809" into the existing [tool.uv] dev-dependencies
section (the uv-managed dev-dependencies you already use) so there is a single
source of truth for dev dependencies; ensure the entry uses the same
quoting/format style as other uv dev-dependencies and update any
ordering/comments to keep the file consistent.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - swag_mcp/utils/validators.py:427]
In swag_mcp/utils/validators.py around lines 425-427, there is a commented-out
computation of full_codepoint for surrogate pairs that should not remain as dead
code; either remove those commented lines or wire the computation into
diagnostics: if you opt to remove, delete the three commented lines; if you opt
to use it, uncomment and compute full_codepoint = 0x10000 + ((codepoint -
0xD800) << 10) + (next_codepoint - 0xDC00) and include that value (preferably
hex-formatted) in the exception/log message raised when surrogate-pair handling
fails so diagnostics include the actual combined codepoint.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - swag_mcp/utils/validators.py:559]
In swag_mcp/utils/validators.py around line 559, the boolean guard "return not
(len(decoded_text.strip()) == 0 and len(sample) > 0)" is correct but dense;
introduce a named boolean (e.g., is_decoded_empty_with_sample =
len(decoded_text.strip()) == 0 and len(sample) > 0) and then return the negation
(return not is_decoded_empty_with_sample) to improve readability.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_behavior_services.py:245]
In tests/test_behavior_services.py around lines 243 to 245, the test asserts the
config file exists but the create call was commented out; restore the create
step by invoking the create call inline and awaiting it to avoid unused
variables (e.g., await
swag_service.create_config(SwagConfigRequest(**base_config))) before asserting
config_file.exists(), and remove the commented-out request/result lines.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_concurrency_race_bugs.py:96]
In tests/test_concurrency_race_bugs.py around lines 93 to 96, the assertion
checking validation error wording is too narrow and can false-negative across
implementations; broaden the set of keywords (e.g., add synonyms like "format",
"syntax", "illegal", "unsupported", "malformed") and perform the membership
check case-insensitively (lowercase the error message before checking) so the
assertion accepts common variant phrasings while still ensuring user-friendly
messages.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_concurrency_race_bugs.py:456]
In tests/test_concurrency_race_bugs.py around lines 455-456, the lock_errors
aggregation was commented out and should be reintroduced for visibility: restore
the list comprehension that collects results indicating a lock-related error
(e.g., lock_errors = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, str) and "lock_error"
in r]) but do not treat those as test failures; instead keep the existing
failure check focused on non-lock errors (filter results for errors that are not
lock-related) and optionally log or print lock_errors for debugging so they
appear in test output without causing the assertion to fail.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_docker_chaos_bugs.py:152]
In tests/test_docker_chaos_bugs.py around lines 145-152 the multi-line string
expression creates a tuple (triggering the SyntaxWarning about a string object
not being callable) and the function signature uses a default of
num_lines=num_lines which is confusing; change the function signature to def
generate_large_logs(num_lines): and replace the tuple-producing multi-line
expression with a single string (either by placing the literal parts adjacent or
concatenating with +) so log_entry becomes one continuous f-string containing
the timestamp, level, message and extra text, then yield log_entry.encode() as
before.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_error_recovery_bugs.py:182]
In tests/test_error_recovery_bugs.py around lines 181-182, the test expects an
OSError/PermissionError/FileNotFoundError but the partial-write mock does not
actually raise, so the code path never triggers the exception; update the test
so the mocked partial-write operation explicitly raises an OSError (or
PermissionError) when invoked (e.g., configure the mock's side_effect to raise
an OSError with an appropriate errno) so that await
swag_service.update_config(edit_request) enters the error path and the
pytest.raises assertion succeeds; keep the pytest.raises tuple but ensure the
mock raises one of those exceptions.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_error_recovery_bugs.py:407]
In tests/test_error_recovery_bugs.py around lines 406-407, the test currently
expects OSError/PermissionError/FileNotFoundError but the code raises ValueError
("Configuration file context-cleanup-test.conf contains binary content or is
unsafe to read") when permissions are 0o000; update the test to include
ValueError in the pytest.raises tuple (or assert that a ValueError with the
expected message is raised) so the test accepts the actual, expected behavior.---

- [ ] [AI PROMPT - tests/test_template_injection_bugs.py:44]
In tests/test_template_injection_bugs.py around lines 40 to 44, the payload is
wrapped in parentheses with a trailing comma which makes it a 1-element tuple;
remove the trailing comma and surrounding parentheses so the entry is a plain
string (i.e., make it a single quoted string containing the payload), and
optionally annotate the ssti_payloads list with List[str] or add a runtime
assertion like assert all(isinstance(p, str) for p in ssti_payloads) to catch
regressions.
